Effective patient monitoring is crucial for healthcare, particularly in areas with limited access to medical professionals.

Our device transmits real-time heart rate, SpO2, and temperature readings to doctors, relatives, and authorized personnel via an IoT dashboard. Additionally, it triggers automatic emergency alerts with location data through phone calls, SMS, and emails, while simultaneously sounding a local buzzer for immediate actions.

Our low-cost, IoT-based health monitoring device addresses key challenges like infrequent monitoring and delayed response. It offers remote access for doctors, automatic emergency alerts (calls, texts, emails) with location data, and reduces healthcare costs by enabling home-based care. This improves overall patient outcomes and accessibility, especially in regions with limited medical resources.
