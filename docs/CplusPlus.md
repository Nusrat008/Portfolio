### **C Programming**
Story behind the C programming:
Motivated by my passion for engineering, I used the three-month gap before starting university to improve my programming skills. Even though there weren't many resources available in Bangla, I stumbled upon Tamim Shariar Subin's C++ book, which I completted eagerly, building a strong foundation in C programming. Then, I solved 52 challenging problems on Dimik O J by Tamim Shariar Subin, sharpening my problem-solving skills independently.

After starting university, I found my self-directed learning in C programming incredibly helpful for navigating the advanced topics in my academic courses. Mastering the basics not only allowed me to excel in introductory courses but also facilitated a deeper understanding of more complex subjects.
