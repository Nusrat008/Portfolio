### **ðŸ’¡ Story behind to Pursue EEE at CUET**

Since childhood, I loved learning math and science, enjoying solving math problems. When I was in 9th grade,I came to know the exciting world of Physics and Math in a bit broader range. From that time, I started to dream of being an engineer. Later, in 12th grade, I got introduced to electricity and electronics. **I found my passion in solving electronics problems and dreamt of studying EEE.**


I worked hard to prepare myself to get a chance at the top Engineering Universities in Bangladesh. After completing higher secondary school, I took part in admission tests and got chances at CUET and KUET. I also got a chance at DU and had the opportunity to study engineering there. 
 
But I chose an Engineering University over University of Dhaka(DU). I was in confusion about where I should go, CUET or Khulna University of Engineering and Technology(KUET). As both of them are considered top Engineering universities in Bangladesh, and my hometown is near CUET, I decided to go to CUET, EEE after discussing with my family. And my journey through my passionate field starts here at CUET. **A long way to go yet.**
