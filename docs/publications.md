**Abstract:** Diabetes is a widespread chronic metabolic disorder that affects a substantial portion of the global population and requires diligent management and continuous medical supervision. Traditional glucose monitoring methods often involve invasive procedures that cause discomfort and increase the risk of infection. With the rapid advancements of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing, healthcare is evolving for early disease detection and personalized treatment solutions. The aim of this research is to develop a system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) for non-invasive diabetes detection using Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. Our system leverages machine learning models, such as XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM, to accurately classify diabetic patients using statistical features collected from PPG signals and metadata. To ensure model robustness, we employed a fivefold cross-validation approach. The hardware technology includes a portable, cost-effective system with a simple NIR sensor and a high-performing ESP32 module that minimizes user discomfort and ensures easy integration. Deployed on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, our system enables real-time data collection and analysis, providing users with a convenient web application for monitoring their diabetic status. The performance of the developed system has been tested with two different datasets: the PPG-BP dataset and the Mazandaran dataset, achieving 87.88% and 90% accuracy, respectively. The results demonstrate the potential of the designed system to revolutionize diabetes management by providing a non-invasive, accessible, and accurate solution for early-stage detection.

<!-- **Abstract:** This study introduces a Surface Plasmon 
Resonance (SPR) sensor based on a Photonic Crystal Fiber 
(PCF) aimed at the early screening of malaria in blood 
samples. The sensor is designed with a circular PCF structure 
that features hexagonally arranged air holes and a gold
coated exterior. It facilitates surface plasmon excitation at the 
metal-analyte interface. Performance evaluations of the 
sensor against normal and malaria-infected red blood cells 
(RBC) at various stages-ring, trophozoite, and schizont were 
conducted using numerical simulations through the Finite 
Element Method (FEM) in COMSOL Multiphysics v5.6, with 
each stage having unique refractive indices. The proposed 
sensor exhibits remarkable sensitivity and minimal 
confinement loss, achieving wavelength sensitivities of 
12,857.143 nm/RIU, 7,083.33 nm/RIU, and 4,500 nm/RIU for 
the ring-stage, trophozoite-stage, and schizont-stage, 
respectively. The corresponding amplitude sensitivities are 
1,741.95 RIU-1, 1,518.886 RIU-1, and 766.734 RIU-1. The 
corresponding figure of merit (FOM) is calculated as 267.86, 
202.38, and 128.57. Additionally, the sensor exhibits low 
confinement losses of 8.48 dB/cm for normal RBC, 4.79 dB/cm 
for ring-stage, 2.54 dB/cm for trophozoite-stage, and 1.66 
dB/cm for schizont-stage infected RBC. These results 
underscore the sensor's potential for accurate, label-free 
malaria detection and offer a promising solution for portable, 
real-time diagnostic applications.  -->
